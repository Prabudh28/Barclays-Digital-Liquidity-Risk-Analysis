# Barclays-Digital-Liquidity-Risk-Analysis
MSc FinTech project: Basel III liquidity risk analysis and Barclay's digital-transformation strategy, including LCR &amp; Lagged Reserve Accounting modelling, stress-tests, and blockchain/AI risk-management recommendations


# Strategic Risk Assessment and Digital Transformation – Barclays (Academic Project, 2025)

## Goal
Make **digital recommendations** to enhance Barclays' **liquidity risk management** and **regulatory compliance** according to Basel III.

## Background

This study examines the **Annual Reports of Barclays PLC (2023 & 2024)** and frames the advisory work framework.
- **Evaluation of liquidity risk** (Lagged Reserve Accounting and Liquidity Coverage Ratio)
- **Digital transformation** opportunities in risk & compliance.

This assignment was produced as an integral assignment of the **Banking Technology (7FNCE031W.2)** module of the MSc FinTech programme at Westminster Business School.

## ☕ Main Analysis
### 1. Liquidity Risk Modeling
* **Lagged Reserve Accounting (LRA):
- 2023: Average Daily £53.9 bn | Base Reserve £8.09 bn | Final Reserve £7.09 bn
- 2024: Average Daily £56.1 billion | Base Reserve £8.42 billion | Final Reserve £6.42 billion.

* **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR
- Base-case LCR grew from **102% (2023)** to **111% (2024)** in our projections.
- Barclays' own Reported ratios were higher (161% → 172%) as a result of regulatory HQLA provisions and off-balance-sheet treatments.

* **Scenario Stress-Test
- +15% cash outflow shock lowers LCR to ~96.8% (below Basel III floor), demonstrating possible weakness in extreme distress conditions.

### 2. Risk Mitigation & Digital Strategy
Diversified funding sources and increased HQLA cushions (2022-24).
* **Liquidity forecasting led by machine learning** and **cloud-based real-time reserve.
* Provided **blockchain-driven AML and inter-bank payment products** for enhanced compliance and operational efficiencies.

### 3. Strategic Recommendations
Upgrade risk systems to Basel III end-game standards compliance.
Utilize blockchain and AI for real-time analytics of liquidity and automated regulatory reporting.
* Improve contingency funding and stress-testing frameworks.

## ????️ Tools & Skills
